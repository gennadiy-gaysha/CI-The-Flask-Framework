<!--
When our index.html file loads, Flask inherits everything from the base template.
It then looks for a block element (which we called 'content') and injects that content
into it.
The word 'content' is just a word that we chose, but we could have called the block
anything, not just 'content'. -->

{%extends 'base.html'%} {% block content%}
<h1>Home Page</h1>
{%endblock%}
